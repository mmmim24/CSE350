# Sexual Harrasment Prevention & Protection Cell
  
This is the frontend repository of our CSE-350 project deployed in [vercel](https://vercel.com/) . If you hit the [https://shppc-sust.vercel.app/](https://shppc-sust.vercel.app/), it will take you to the homepage. Vercel is a platform for hosting `next.js` projects which are full stack(frontend+backend) application. We used `vite+react.js` as the frontend and `node+express.js` as backend so we had to host the backend seprately. As we used `react.js`, we have to put some instructions to vercel as [vercel.json](https://github.com/CSE350/frontend/Sexual_Harrasment_Prevention_Cell/vercel.json) file.




# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
