# Sexual Harrasment Prevention & Protection Cell
  
This is the main repository of our CSE-350 project. It has both the frontend and the backend folder but the frontend is deployed in [vercel](https://vercel.com/) . If you hit the [https://shppc-sust.vercel.app/](https://shppc-sust.vercel.app/), it will take you to the homepage.  
  
  
The backend directory in this folder is maintained for future dockerization purposes. And we have a separate backend repository [CSE350-backend](https://github.com/mmmim24/cse350-backend) deployed in [railway](https://railway.app)
